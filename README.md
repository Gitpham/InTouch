# InTouch
InTouch APp Repo
This is Phoenix and Tonio's first app!

Idea:
An app where one can create a group of friends to keep in touch with (Hence the name, "InTouch"). The user will be able to create a group of people to call on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis during select hours. The app will then randomly prompt the user to call the peopel in their group at these hours. 

Other possible features include the ability to take notes on conversations, see calling stats, etc.
